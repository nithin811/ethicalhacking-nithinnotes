Notes:
🔌 What is a Network?
A network is a group of interconnected devices (computers, servers, etc.) that can communicate with each other. It allows for sharing of resources and data.

🧩 What are Subnets?
Subnets (sub-networks) divide a larger network into smaller, manageable pieces. They help:

Improve security
Optimize performance
Reduce traffic congestion
📡 Protocols Related to Networks
IP (Internet Protocol): Assigns unique addresses to devices and routes packets across networks.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, connection-oriented protocol for tasks like file transfers.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Faster, connectionless protocol used for broadcasting or streaming.
🆔 What is a MAC ID?
A MAC (Media Access Control) ID is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication on a physical network segment.

🔄 TCP vs UDP
Feature	TCP	UDP
Type	Connection-oriented	Connectionless
Speed	Slower	Faster
Reliability	High (error-checked)	Low (no guarantee of delivery)
Use Cases	File transfers, email	Live broadcasts, VoIP
💣 Payload vs Backdoor
Payload: The actual data delivered during an exploit (can be malicious or useful).
Backdoor: A secret method of accessing a system. Used by attackers for future access.
Why IP is injected into the backdoor and not the payload?
Because the backdoor often needs to establish a connection back to the attacker (reverse shell), it includes the IP address to know where to connect. Payloads, on the other hand, usually just execute a task and exit.
🕰 Attack Timeline
Describes the phases of a cyberattack:

Reconnaissance
Scanning
Gaining Access
Maintaining Access
Covering Tracks
🎣 Phishing
A social engineering attack where attackers trick users into giving sensitive information (e.g., passwords) through fake websites or emails.

🖱 Cursor AI
Likely refers to AI tools that observe user behavior through cursor movement (used in fraud detection or tracking).

🧭 Reconnaissance
The first stage of hacking, involving gathering information about the target (IPs, domains, services, etc.).

🐍 Request Module (Python)
A popular Python library for sending HTTP requests. Used for:

Web scraping
API interaction
Sending GET/POST requests
import requests
response = requests.get("https://example.com")
print(response.text)
🌐 API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules that allows programs to communicate with each other. In hacking, APIs are often used to:

Automate attacks
Query information from services (e.g., HaveIBeenPwned API)
🕰 Wayback Machine
An archive of the internet (https://archive.org/web/). Used by hackers to:

View old versions of websites
Find outdated and vulnerable endpoints
🛡 HaveIBeenPwned
A service that lets you check if your email or password has been exposed in a data breach.

⚙ Nmap Command Breakdown
nmap -Pn -A -sV -O -oN scan.txt --script vuln -vv -p 1-1000 -sS -T4 192.168.1.10
Flag	Description
-Pn	Skip host discovery
-A	Aggressive scan (OS, versions, traceroute, script)
-sV	Service/version detection
-O	OS detection
-oN scan.txt	Output to a file in normal format
--script vuln	Use vulnerability detection scripts
-vv	Very verbose output
-p 1-1000	Scan ports 1–1000
-sS	Stealth SYN scan
-T4	Faster scan timing
192.168.1.10	Target IP address
🧱 Composition of IP Address
An IPv4 address is made up of 4 octets (8-bit numbers) like:

192.168.1.1
Each part ranges from 0–255. Example structure:

Network portion: Identifies the network.
Host portion: Identifies the device in the network.
